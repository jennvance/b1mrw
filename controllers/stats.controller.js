//the purpose of a controller is to interpret business logic from a model and turn it into
//a presentational format
//a place to keep UI bindings in sync with model










//Alternative syntax
// angular.module('app')
// 	.controller('myController', myController)



//The service method is for creating constructors..
//a service must be run before the other methods
//SERVICES are used for non-presenational logic, i.e. business logic.
//example: communicating with server via REST endpoints over HTTP


//MODEL manages all data
//responds to requests from view and methods from controller for updating itself

//CONTROLLER responds to user input, interacts with model to update
